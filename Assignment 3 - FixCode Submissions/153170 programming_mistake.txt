// 1: Undeclared Variables:

//header files
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

//main function
int main()
{
	//decalaring variable of type integer
 	int x;
 
 	//prompt
 	cout<<"Enter the integer this program will print it."<<endl;
 	
 	//taking input 
	cin>>x;
	
	//printing entered number
	cout<<x;
	return 0;
}
"Huh? Why do I get an error?"
 Answer:"Because variable 'x' is not decalared here."

2: Uninitialized variables:

//2: Uninitialized variables:

//Header files
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

//main function
int main()
{
	//decalaring and initiating variable
	int count=0;
	
	//prompt
	cout<<"Enter number below 100 to initiate."<<endl;
	cin>>count;
	
	//loop
	while(count<100)
	{
		//incrementing 
		count++;
		
		//printing 
		cout<<count<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
"Why doesn't my program enter the while loop?"
Answer:"Because variable count was not initialized and there was no incrementing in the loop."

3: Setting a variable to an uninitialized value:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	//initializing a and b
	int a, b=0;

		
	int sum;
	
	//taking input in a
	cout<<"Enter two numbers to add: ";
	cin>>a;
	cin>>b;
	
	//initializing sum after taking input in a and b
	sum=a+b;
	cout<<"The sum is: "<<sum;

}
"What's wrong with my program?"
Answer:"Sum variable was initialized before tking input in var a and b. Variables a and b was initialized to 0."

4: Using a single equal sign to check equality:
//4: Using a single equal sign to check equality:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	//adding header files and used double equal sign 
	char x='Y';
	while(x=='Y')
	{
		//...
	cout<<"Continue? (Y/N)";
	cin>>x;
	}
}

"Why doesn't my loop ever end?"
Answer:"Using '==' instead of '=' to end loop when character other than 'Y' entered." 

5: Undeclared Functions:
//5: Undeclared Functions:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// function decalartion
void menu();
//main Function
int main()
{
	//adding header files and function decalaration
	menu();
	return 0;
}
void menu()
{
//...
}

"Why do I get an error about menu being unknown?"
Answer:"In this section function decalaration was missing. To resolve the issue i added the function decalartion of menu function."

6: Extra Semicolons:
//6: Extra Semicolons:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	//adding header files and remove semicolon at end of for loop
	for(int x=0; x<100; x++)
	{
		cout<<x;
	}
	return 0;
}


"Why does it output 100?"
Answer:"There was a semicolon at the end of the for loop, which terminates the loop so i removed it to solve the error."
7: Overstepping array boundaries:
//7: Overstepping array boundaries:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	//adding headerfiles storing integer in array and in for loop initialzed x with 0 to less than 10
	int array[10]={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
	//...
	for(int x=0; x<10; x++)
	{
		cout<<array[x]<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
"Why doesn't it output the correct values?"
Answer:"Array was not initialized and index was set to 1 that is why garbage and wrong values was there in the output."

8: Integer division
//8: Integer division

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	//adding header files and adding decimal to integers 
	double half = 1/2;
	cout<<half<<endl;
	half = 1.0/2.0;
	cout<<half;
	return 0;
}

This code sets half to 0 not 0.5! Why? 
Answer:"Because 1 and 2 are integer constants."


9: Variable Name Styles

//9: Variable Name Styles

//Take a look at the below program. Can you see anything wrong?
//#include<iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
//using namespace std;

 
int main()
{
	char CatName[20] = "fluffy";
	char dogName[20] = "fido";
	char rat_Name[20] = "fester";
	int Catage = 3;
	int dogs_age = 4;
	int ratage = 1;
	char myPet[20];
	int itsAge;
	
	strcpy(myPet,rat_Name);
	itsAge = ratage;
	printf("My pet is %s\n",myPet);
}
Besides the obviously bizarre choice of having a pet rat, do you notice anything? 
Answer:"There is no mistake in ninth section, just copying the string into MyPet."

10 Misusing the && and || operators:

//10 Misusing the && and || operators:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int value;
	do
	{
	//...
	value=10;
	}while(!(value==10) && !(value==20));
	return 0;
}

"Huh? Even though value is 10 the program loops. Why?"
Answer:"Logical operator OR were used. It was wrong approach so to resolve the error i used && opeartor."
