1: Undeclared Variables:

int main()
{
//Programming Mistakes Fix 1: Declared 'x' (153169 Ahmed Jamil)
int x;
cin>>x;
cout<<x;
}

"Huh? Why do I get an error?"
 

2: Uninitialized variables:

//Programming Mistakes Fix 2: Initialized 'count' to 0 and incremented at end of loop (153169 Ahmed Jamil)
int count =0;
while(count<100)
{
cout<<count;

count++;
}

"Why doesn't my program enter the while loop?"




3: Setting a variable to an uninitialized value:
//Programming Mistakes Fix 3: Placed 'int sum=a+b' after inputs (153169 Ahmed Jamil)
int a, b;
cout<<"Enter two numbers to add: ";
cin>>a>>b;
int sum=a+b;
cout<<"The sum is: "<<sum;
When Run:
Enter two numbers to add: 1 3
The sum is: -1393

"What's wrong with my program?"

//Programming Mistakes Fix 4: replaced x='Y' with x=='Y' (153169 Ahmed Jamil)
4: Using a single equal sign to check equality:

char x='Y';
while(x=='Y')
{
//...
cout<<"Continue? (Y/N)";
cin>>x;
}

"Why doesn't my loop ever end?"
 

//Programming Mistakes Fix 5: Added header for menu() function (153169 Ahmed Jamil)
5: Undeclared Functions:

void menu();
int main()
{
menu();
}
void menu()
{
//...
}

"Why do I get an error about menu being unknown?"



//Programming Mistakes Fix 6: Removed extra semicoln after for loop (153169 Ahmed Jamil)
6: Extra Semicolons:

for(int x=0; x<100; x++)
cout<<x;

"Why does it output 100?"


//Programming Mistakes Fix 7: fixed condition for overstepping array loop (153169 Ahmed Jamil)
7: Overstepping array boundaries:

int array[10];
//...
for(int x=1; x<10; x++)
cout<<array[x];

"Why doesn't it output the correct values?"


//Programming Mistakes Fix 8: Casted numerator to double (153169 Ahmed Jamil)
8: Integer division

For example:
double half = (double)>1/2;

This code sets half to 0 not 0.5! Why? Because 1 and 2 are integer constants.


9: Variable Name Styles

Take a look at the below program. Can you see anything wrong?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

main()
{
char CatName[20] = "fluffy";
char dogName[20] = "fido";
char rat_Name[20] = "fester";
int Catage = 3;
int dogs_age = 4;
int ratage = 1;
char myPet[20];
int itsAge;

strcpy(myPet,rat_Name);
itsAge = ratage;
printf("My pet is %s\n",myPet);
}

Besides the obviously bizarre choice of having a pet rat, do you notice anything? 


10 Misusing the && and || operators:

int value;
do
{
//...
value=10;
}while(!(value==10) || !(value==20))

"Huh? Even though value is 10 the program loops. Why?"
